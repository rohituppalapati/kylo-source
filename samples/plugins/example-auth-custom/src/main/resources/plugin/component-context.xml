  <!-- Note that prior to Kylo 0.6 this file's name is the required file name of a
       plugin context XML file.

       This file name has been deprecated (although it still works) in favor of the
       name "plugin-context.xml" to make it clear what its purpose is.  This file
       is purposely left empty.  But if your plugin is to be deployed to a Kylo version
       earlier than 0.6 then you should use this file name instead of plugin-context.xml -->
